 Installation of hollow
========================

1) Install psyco through your package manager.

2) Install the hollow package::

      python setup.py install --user

   It will want to install three scripts into a script directory; you
   might have to set it appropriately with option
   ``--install-scripts``; I use ``~/bin`` for this purpose.

   See ``python setup.py install --help`` for help on using setuptools
   ("easy_install").


The installation procedure will make three scripts available: See the
web site

  http://hollow.sourceforge.net

the README, and the examples to learn how to use ``hollow``.


hollow
   The program that creates the cavity pdb file.

hollow-volume
   Calculates the volume of a structure.

hollow-asa
   Calculates the surface are of a structure.


.. Note:: Oliver Beckstein repackaged the original hollow 1.1
   distribution so that it can be installed in the standard python
   fashion. Thus examples on the website might work a little bit
   differently when using this installation (e.g. you don't have to
   say ``python hollow.py ...``). If you have problems with the
   installation then try installing and using the zip file from the
   website (*hollow.zip*) first.
